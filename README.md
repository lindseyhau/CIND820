## Data
Bike Share Toronto Ridership Data (2018) is from Toronto Parking Authority, published on https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/. The dataset consists of data for more than 1.9 million bikeshare trips, with 9 features.
Toronto City Centre Hourly Weather Data (2018) is from Government of Canada, and can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/jasonzxho/toronto-city-centre-hourly-weather-data-20172020?select=Weather+2018. The dataset consists of 8760 instances of hourly weather data, with 28 features.

## 2. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved formating the datatypes of features appropriately, checking for duplcate and null values, imputing null values, modifying and simplifying categorical data, and preliminary feature selection and engineering. The datasets were combined and transformed for model building.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on each dataset using charts, histograms, correlation heatmaps, and lineplots to identify relationships between variables and patterns in bike share usage. 

## 4. Model Evaluation
An inital model evaluation was performed using Linear Regression. The model will be further improved, and addition models will be evaluated using random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression.
